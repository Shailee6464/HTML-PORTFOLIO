    <H2>RECENT WATCHES ON NETFLIX</H2>
    <H3>FOOL ME ONCE</H3>
    <P>It is a thrill series that can be precisely defined as twisty and turny. <br>
        It has so many twists and turns,the plot keeps on unravelling a new layer in each episode. <br>
         I loved it,kept me hooked till the very last ep.One time binge worthy show!!
    </P>
    <h3>My life with the walter boys</h3>
    <p>Finally watched it, as was suggested too many times by netflix. <br>
          I found it way too similar to the summer i turned pretty. <br>
              If you are not a huge romance fan,but like easy going series,it can be the one. <br>
                    An okay okay watch for me <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Don't worry Darling</h3>
    <p>
        It's not a series,but a movie that has a plot that i actually hated at the end. <br>
        They tried making it extremely mysterious but in the end its kinda not to that level mystery. <br>
        It is a major don't watch warning tho I only started because of Harry Styles. <br>
